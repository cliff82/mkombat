   <h1><strong>Bio: </strong> The Predator is not here to rule us. He does not wish to destroy the realms. He and others of his alien race merely fight - and kill - for sport and honor. There is much kombat in Earthrealm. Shao Kahn and then Shinnok thought themselves konquerers. They were defeated. The Predator will not be. The humans, Outworlders and Netherrealm demons will fall to his superior weapons, tactics and strength. Their skins will make fine trophies.
