   <h1><strong>Bio: </strong> Kotal was a young boy in the warrior realm of Osh-Tekk when it was conquered and merged with Outworld by Shao Kahn. He grew up admiring the Outworld emperor, but kept hidden from him a secret portal to Earthrealm his people had established in their distant past. Kotal's "magical" appearances and demonstrations of great power in Earthrealm led its inhabitants to declare him a god, whom they called Buluc. After Shao Kahn was killed in the war with Earthrealm, Kotal served his heir, Mileena. But her instability eventually led him to overthrow her and assume the emperorship. Despite his current detente with longtime enemy Earthrealm, Kotal Kahn is still embroiled in konfl√Æct, as Mileena attempts to regain her throne through civil war.
