<h1><strong>Bio: </strong> Cassandra Carlton Cage, the daughter of Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade, has a lot to live up to. Her parents were among the few kombatants to survive the wars against Outworld and Netherrealm, and were instrumental to Earthrealm's victories. Cassie is as strong-willed -and occasionally hotheaded - as her mother; and as quickwitted as her beloved dad, which makes her popular within her Special Forces unit. But these traits hide a seed of self-doubt cultivated by the demanding nature of her commanding officer Sonya.
