   <h1><strong>Bio: </strong> Reptile's home realm of Zaterra was conquered and assimilated long ago by the Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn, leaving Reptile the sole survivor. Reptile has since served Outworld's rulers faithfully - biding his time until he can find a way to recreate his Raptor race. Reptile possesses many reptilian traits, which make him a formidable foe.
