   <h1><strong>Bio: </strong> General Sonya Blade has been through a lot since helping Raiden defeat the Netherrealm and Shinnok 25 years ago, including marriage to action hero Johnny Cage, with whom she had a daughter. But parenting was not Sonya's strong suit. Her commitment to her career and difficulty opening up emotionally led to their split five years ago. Now faced with possible renewed hostilities with Outworld, Sonya must confront her past by working with her estranged family.
