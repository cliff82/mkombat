   <h1><strong>Bio: </strong> Originally a Netherrealm demon, Quan Chi evolved into one of the most powerful sorcerers in the realms. He serves the High Lord Shinnok, who was imprisoned in the Netherrealm by his fellow Elder Gods. Twenty-five years ago, Quan Chi helped Shinnok escape his hellish prison. Together they waged war on an Earthrealm weakened by its conflict with Outworld. When Shinnok was defeated, Quan Chi was driven underground. He continues to manipulate events from parts unknown.
