   <h1><strong>Bio: </strong> The dual being known as Ferra/Torr is mysterious even to their closest allies. It's rumored that Torr and Ferra were Outworld citizens, captured and permanently tethered to each other by the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung in the bowels of his Flesh Pits. They're more likely members of a forgotten symVariation tic race, in which the "rider" bonds with a "mount." The rider, Ferra, serves as the de facto brains of the duo, while the hulking Torr is the muscle. It's possible they communicate with each other telepathically, or that Ferra can actually understand the booming grunts that are Torr's usual vocalizations. Found roaming the Tarkatan Wastes by Imperial troops, Ferra/Torr was trained/coerced into serving as Kotal Kahn's personal bodyguard.
