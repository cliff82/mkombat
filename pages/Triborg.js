   <h1><strong>Bio:</strong> Years ago, the Lin Kuei Grandmaster determined that his assassin clan would be more effective by eliminating their human weaknesses. They would adopt cybernetic bodies and technologically enhanced minds. In preparation, the Grandmaster ordered all members to submit to tests, during which their physical and mental data was secretly recorded and stored in an offsite database. After Sub-Zero eliminated all cyber-Lin Kuei, Special Forces discovered their hidden data storage site. They brought the drives to a secret S-F weapons lab, then downloaded several files into a test body. The consciousness of Sektor, Cyrax and Smoke somehow intermingled and brought the body to life. The "Triborg" wiped the lab clean of human occupants - and now seeks to eliminate all organic life.
